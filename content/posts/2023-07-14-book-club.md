*My kind of library*

I recently got back into reading after a few months hiatus, and realised this blog would be an ideal place to keep track of what books I've been reading, and share any recommendations with the world (should anyone actually be reading this!).  

### Books

**The Odyssey - Homer, translation by Robert Fagles**  
After reading a few books about Greek mythology, including Stephen Fry's excellent Mythos and Heroes, I decided to read an actual classic itself, beginning with the Odyssey, one of Homers two epic poems. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and was pleasantly surprised by its readability - I don't read of lot of poetry and the book is written in verse, but for the most part, it reads like prose.  

**The Unfolding of Language - Guy Deutscher**  
TBD

### A few favourites that pre-date the blog
**Nelson Mandela - Long Walk to Freedom**  
Everyone on earth should read this book! It's been some years since I read it, but I always remember it having a profound impact. I strongly beleive the world would be a better place if everyone had to read it.

**Richard Dawkins - The Selfish Gene**  
Although the author has become a little controversial in recent years - I owe a lot to this book. I read it during a formative period, inbetween my Bachelors and joining LSTM to study for a masters. It really opened my eyes to the wonderful world of evolutionary biology, and I've been hooked ever since. It also helped to awaken a thirst for knowledge which has stayed with me ever since. 

**The Ramayana - Linda Egenes and Kumuda Reddy**  
This was the first (and only) version of the Ramayana I've read. The Ramayana literally means the Journey of Ram, and tells the story of Rama, the prince of Ayodha, who wages a war against the demon king Ravana to rescue his wife, Sita. And it is this victory of light triumphing over evil for which we celebrate Diwali.  It's a really beautiful book.
