Dual-active ingredient ITNs are now being deployed in sub-Saharan Africa [en masse](https://allianceformalariaprevention.com/itn-dashboards/net-mapping-project/). We know that these nets are not only highly effective, but effective against pyrethroid-resistant malaria vectors. This should help to reduce the burden of malaria. But given the evolutionary adaptability of malaria mosquitoes, we must rapidly find ways to detect resistance before it becomes widespread, in order to protect the lifespan of these critical tools.

How do we identify the genetic mutations that confer insecticide resistance? When a beneficial mutation arises — like one that helps a mosquito survive insecticide exposure — it spreads rapidly through the population, creating a genetic signature where genetic diversity plummets as the advantageous variant sweeps to high frequency. We can exploit this signature to pinpoint regions of the genome that are under selection and threatening malaria vector control efforts. 

In a new pre-print on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.16.664900), we present a new web resource, the [**Malaria Vector Selection Atlas**](https://anopheles-genomic-surveillance.github.io/selection-atlas/), a database of selection signals in wild Anopheles mosquitoes within the [Vector Observatory](https://www.malariagen.net/vobs/). We analysed whole-genome sequence data from over 4,300 mosquitoes collected across 21 African countries, using population genomic methods to scan the genomes of our cohorts for these telltale signs of recent positive selection. The atlas reveals both familiar loci and new threats: we confirm selection at established resistance genes like the *Vgsc* (the target of DDT and pyrethroids) and metabolic enzyme clusters like the *Cyp6p* locus that break down insecticides. But we also discovered novel signals including a diacylglycerol kinase on the X chromosome that may represent a previously unknown resistance mechanism. The selection atlas is powered by an automated computational workflow that enables continuous updates as new data become available. As we integrate more recent data, we envisage that the resource will provide a crucial early warning system for tracking mosquito evolution in near real-time, helping to inform evidence-based decisions about where and how best to deploy our limited vector control tools.
