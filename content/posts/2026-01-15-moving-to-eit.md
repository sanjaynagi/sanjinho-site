A belated update to share some news: I've recently moved to the [Ellison Institute of Technology](https://eit.org/) to join the pathogen programme. 

I’m incredibly grateful for my time at LSTM, where I spent the early years of my scientific career and was able to work with many great people on problems in vector control and vector genomics. I’ve been lucky to grow there as a scientist, and to form friendships with outstanding colleagues from around the world (please keep in touch!). After nine years at the school, however, I felt ready for a new challenge.

At EIT, we are developing next-generation tools in improve and transform the diagnosis of infectious pathogens. It's an ambitious aim, but the programme is already packed with brilliant people and I'm excited to be a part of it! We are actively looking for forward-thinking, driven data scientists and data engineers - if that sounds like you, then please get in touch.
