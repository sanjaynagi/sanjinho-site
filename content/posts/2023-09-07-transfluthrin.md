*Mosquito Shield™* - a novel spatial repellent product for the Malaria vector control market.

A few words on the greatest polyfluorinated pyrethroid I’ve ever written a thesis about – Transfluthrin. Back in my first foray into vector control, I was working in Mumbai at [Godrej](https://godrej.com), looking at resistance to the main active ingredient in their flagship insect repellent brand, [GoodKnight™](https://www.goodknight.in/), for my MSc dissertation. With randomised-controlled trials (RCTs) of the SC Johnson Johnson product *Mosquito Shield™* ongoing in sub-Saharan Africa, now seems an opportune time to rehash those findings.

Transfluthrin is a vapour-phase pyrethroid often used in domestic household products, such as sprays and liquid vapourisers. It repels mosquitoes, as well as incapacitating them to prevent host-seeking and blood-feeding. It's been particularly popular in the South Asian market for a number of years, with South America seemingly playing catch up (C'mon guys). And, in recent years, it's also been explored as a novel vector control tool for malaria.

#### Transfluthrin is somewhat resistant to metabolic attack 

As well as resulting in its high vapour pressure compared to common pyrethroids, the fluorination of transfluthrin makes it somewhat resistant to metabolic attack from Cytochrome P450s. Typically, pyrethroids are metabolised at the 4' position of the phenoxybenzyl ring. In Transfluthrin, however, the fluorines pull electrons away from the benzyl ring, in theory preventing attack by electron-hungry heme molecules within cytochrome P450s.

Earlier research from [Bayer](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0149738), had showed limited to no synergism with PBO in the FuMoz strain of *An. funestus*, suggesting that P450s could not metabolism Transfluthrin. We demonstrated that this wasn't the case across species, however, with PBO synergising volatile transfluthrin in an Indian strain of Culex quinquefasciatus, and showing that the *An. gambiae* P450 CYP6P3 can metabolise Transfluthrin *in vitro*. *In vitro* metabolism was much lower than for Deltamethrin, however, demonstrating Transfluthrin's comparative ability to resist metabolic attack. 

Given that PBO should still synergise transfluthrin in most mosquito strains, the combination of PBO nets and a transfluthrin-based spatial repellent could be a potent combination for vector control. 

#### The effect of *VGSC* knockdown mutations on transfluthrin 

Interestingly, the resistance-breaking potential of transfluthrin doesn't end there.
