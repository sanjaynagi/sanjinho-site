*Parantha heaven.*

Hello, fellow paratha/parantha/parotta enthusiasts! I'm here to share my thoughts 
and reviews on some of the best paranthas I've had the pleasure of 
devouring. As a self-proclaimed parantha addict, I have traveled far 
and wide in search of the perfect parantha. And let me tell you, it's 
been a delicious journey.

**Reviews**

**Anands sweets, LS6 Leeds**  
Anands is my favourite place to visit any time I return to Leeds. It used to be an indian sweet shop, but a few years back they turned it into a cafe, serving a whole range of vegetarian dishes. Its an amazing place which brings me joy just to sit in there, and the channa masala is the best I've ever tasted. The last time I went, the paranthas however, could be better (I'm sorry, Anands!).

**Chaiwala, Bold Street L1 Liverpool**  
These Indian street food places seem to have popped up everywhere. Im not complaining. Chai was delicious, and so was the Samosa pav I had. The parantha could have done with more flavour (I suppose this has to cater to the British palate), but the yoghurt and raita was strangely good. Enjoyable.

**Chai walay, LS6 Leeds**  
I actually found this place whilst trying to visit Anands, on the way back to Liverpool one morning. Anands was closed, so I stopped in my car and desperately googled 'Paranthas Leeds' and this place came up. I was excited. I remember it clearly, a really sunny winters day. And it was good. A massive aloo Parantha, very flaky and very delicious. A bit too oily, though I suspect that may have aided the overall taste. Chai was delicious.

**Zaffran, L8 Liverpool**  
This is one of those ghost restuarants - its just a kitchen featured on JustEat and Deliveroo, you cant sit inside. This poses a problem for me, as I like to eat the Parantha fresh out of the tandoor. The only option - drive right up to the entrance, and sit in my car to eat it. Greasy fingers everywhere, not ideal. The kulchas were nice, but the aloo parantha was fried (not cooked in a tandoor) and I'm fairly sure it came from a frozen packet.

**Paratha Hut, Levenshulme, Manchester**    
I've been meaning to go here for ages. One day I took a cheeky 45 min detour on the way back to leeds. this is a little hut in the corner of a car wash. 
There are many options, and (aloo) paranthas were quite delicious!
