Hello! I'm a Sanjay Curtis Nagi, currently a post-doc at the [Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine](https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/), in the Vector Informatics and Genomics group. 

To date, my work has primarily focused on mosquito vectors of disease. In particular, the rapid evolution and spread of resistance in the major malaria vector, *Anopheles gambiae*, is a major focus, and how we can use population genomics to ultimately inform malaria control programmes. I enjoy developing open-source computational tools that can aid the community and empower researchers to analyse their own data.
